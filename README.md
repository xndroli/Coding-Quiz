# Web API: Coding-Quiz

If you want to becoming a full-stack web developer, it’s likely that you’ll be asked to complete a coding assessment, perhaps as part of an interview process. A typical coding assessment is a combination of multiple-choice questions and interactive coding challenges.

To help you become familiar with these tests is this timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. The app runs in the browser, and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It has a clean, polished, and responsive user interface.
